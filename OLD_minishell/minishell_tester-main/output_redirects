How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.) many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her with their heads downward!

There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it.

I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!” She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, Improve his shining tail, How neatly spread his claws, As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.” Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small “Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?

I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but but it said nothing. her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which “Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all “We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.” It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow “Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William “Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver. the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even “I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued, the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.” speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo “Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly. Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. “You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it sighing. puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:— denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear you thinking of?” bend, I think?” “I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and her daughter “Ah, my dear!

In a little while, however, she again heard a eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.

Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and “He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice!

So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I _think_ I can kick a little!” She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!” then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow?

They all made a rush at Alice the moment she safe in a thick wood. “The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.

Alice replied, who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.” Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any “Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again. Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For think you’re changed, do you?” “I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I “Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar. “And your hair has become very white; Do you think, at your age, it is right?” “In my youth,” Father William replied to his son, “In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box— For anything tougher than suet; “In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law, And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at “And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed “Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. “As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I invent something!” child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. as if nothing had happened. The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his “Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling. “Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting “It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!” “I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an “Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a And beat him when he sneezes: (In which the cook and the baby joined): While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, I beat him when he sneezes; “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,” murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence. Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of “Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” “Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat. Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.
